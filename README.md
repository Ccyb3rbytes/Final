Final Assignment
COURSE OBJECTIVES:
2. Produce Web page layouts and designs in accordance with usability standards and basic graphic design concepts and principles.

3. Apply usability and accessibility standards in Web site structure and organization.

4. Use semantic Hypertext Markup Language (HTML5) to structure Web documents that validate with current W3C standards.

Overview
By now you should have a plan for the website you want to create which includes the wireframe. Continue working on it by setting up your structure with HTML5 elements.

Guidelines and Expectations
Be sure to comment on each section and have some kind of "dummy" content in the document so you can see your structure. There should be a sufficient amount of content to clearly show your work and intentions.

Now that you have experience creating HTML and CSS content, I expect you to stretch your skills to new areas. This HTML should look professional, have a sense of completeness like it is showing the entire picture, and show improvements that demonstrate improved skill.

Create at least 1 HTML page for your final project website. 
Elements should include a body, nav, sections, aside, footer, etc. organized appropriately
Include a description of what the page(s) output in a readme.txt
Use well-formatted, easy-to-read, and commented code
Deliverables:
All files and folders are uploaded to your GitHub repo.
Screenprint of your webpage is uploaded to Canvas, along with the link to your GitHub repo.
